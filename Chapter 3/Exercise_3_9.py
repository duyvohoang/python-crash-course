# Exercise 3.9 of the "Python Crash Course" book.

# Code from 3.4
guests = ['john dewey', 'albert einstein', 'elon musk']
print(f"Hi {guests[0].title()}, do you want to have dinner with me?")
print(f"Hi {guests[1].title()}, do you want to have dinner with me?")
print(f"Hi {guests[2].title()}, do you want to have dinner with me?")

# New code of 3.9
print(f"\nSo, we have {len(guests)} guests.")
